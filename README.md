# Virtual-Painter-Using-Python
The software will allow the user to paint on a canvas using hand gestures. The system requires a webcam as a device. The tools required are Python and its various in-built libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, math, etc. The actual hand gestures made by the user are analyzed by the system to perform a particular task. 
Virtual AI Painter uses OpenCV to track the motion of an object. Using this tracking function the user can draw on the screen by moving the item (which in our project is the human hand) in the air, in front of the webcam. The user can design straightforward objects that are both engaging and difficult using this real-time webcam data that is generated by tracking the movement of the object that we can accomplish with an open CV:

Write and Read Images.
finding faces and identifying their traits.
detection of various shapes, including rectangles, circles, and other shapes, in an image. E.g. coin detection in pictures.
picture recognition of text. e.g. Checking license plates.
can alter the color quality of an image.
creating apps for augmented reality. To read or write to an image or modify an image, use an open CV. convert colored red to binary, HSV, or grayscale. Google's Media Pipe is an open-source, graph-based media processing technology. primarily focuses on facilitating our ability to process media by offering machine learning elements and some integrated computer vision.
